## Our View and Display
- The view for this project will be a couple pages because of how broad fitness/better health is
    - first view is workout calender that displays the workouts you put in
    - the second is BMI info page which will display your range
    - The third will be the nutrition which will show your CPD (calories per day), and the calories you have eaten today
- The display for this project will fetch JSON data from a API/database which will be used to fill in the view.

## Describing our view
- I feel like describing leaves alot of gray area and unknowns. So if you would like to check out some of our example of Views, view (pun intended) theese three link
